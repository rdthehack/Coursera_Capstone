    "## Introduction to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to open a cafe in the best possible location away from other locations in the busy city of Mumbai(aka Bombay). Cafes are a good location for people to sit and work and socialize. They are synonymous with business persons and casual visitors alike. You can hold an interview or catch up with old friends.\n",
    "Thus, foursquare and folium were used to collect the data required and present it in the form of a heatmap.\n",
    "The data is taken from FourSquare API using the requests module to automate the url formation which is difficult to code by hand. We have observed the cafes already present and have decided to find a center which is away from all clusters found. The heatmap allows us to see the density of cafes in locations and we can use this to decide the best location for our cafe."

    "To find a suitable location for a new cafe in a bustling city where there is minimal competition and high chance of success in an area which is not already full of cafes. Do this using neighborhood clustering."

    "This project will be useful for healthcare workers and the general people alike as it aims to bring more healthcare services to a larger number of people. It will help people stay safe and secure from a global pandemic and rest assured that they have the necessary services close by if an emergency occurs and there is a need."

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need the following data to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "• List of neighbourhoods in Mumbai to define the scope and granularity of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Latitude and Longitudinal values of all this neighbourhoods to plot the maps and get further data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Venue data from FourSquare related to cafes to perform clustering and decipher the best area for cafe location.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105+ million places and is used by over 125,000 developers. Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the hospital category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium). In the next section, we will present the Methodology section where we will discuss the steps taken in this project, the data analysis that we did and the machine learning technique that was used."
